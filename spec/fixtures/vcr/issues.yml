        isn''t a big deal, but right now percentage complete is calculated both by

        badges earned + percentage of site3 required badges earned)/ number of sites)`\r\n\r\nThe
        numbers are different, but not enough to make a difference for our purposes
        right now, but eventually we should switch to using completed badges / total
        badges * 100 to calculate % completed for both each website and for total
        completion percentage.  "}]'
